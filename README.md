# sentimental_analysis
This repository contains a sentiment analysis project built using machine learning techniques. It includes pre-trained models, datasets, and vectorizers to analyze and classify text sentiment as positive or negative.

## Project Structure

- **glove/**: Contains pre-trained GloVe embeddings with different dimensionalities (`50d`, `100d`, `200d`, `300d`).
- **kaggle/**: Stores Kaggle dataset files or configurations.
- **sentiment140.xlsx**: Dataset used for training sentiment analysis models.
- **logistic_model_with_vectorizer.sav**: Combined logistic regression model and vectorizer.
- **trained_logistic_model.sav**: Standalone trained logistic regression model.
- **trained_logistic_model_vectorizer.sav**: Vectorizer for transforming text for the logistic model.
- **trained_model.sav**: Final trained model for prediction.
- **vectorizer.sav**: Saved vectorizer for text processing.
- **modelLRBNB**: Notebook with Logistic Regression and Naive Bayes training logic.
- **model_predictions**: Notebook for prediction and testing.
- **glove.6B.50d-300d.txt**: Pre-trained word embeddings.

## Setup Instructions
